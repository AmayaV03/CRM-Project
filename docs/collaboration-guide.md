**Activities**:
- Review backlog items
- Estimate story points
- Identify technical dependencies
- Plan capacity allocation
- Prepare user stories for refinement

#### Sprint Planning Meeting
- **When**: First day of sprint

2. Story point estimation using Planning Poker
3. Task breakdown and assignment
4. Identify risks and dependencies
5. Commit to sprint backlog

### 2. Daily Standup Protocol

**Format**: 15-minute daily meeting
**Time**: 9:00 AM (adjust for team timezone)
**Location**: Physical/Virtual meeting room

**Structure**:
Each team member answers:
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What am I working on today?
3. What blockers or impediments do I have?

**Best Practices**:
- Keep updates concise (2-3 minutes per person)
- Focus on progress toward sprin

### 3. Code Review Process

#### Pull Request Guidelines

**Before Creating PR**:
```bash
# Ensure branch is up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-branch
git rebase main

# Run linting and build
npm run lint
npm run build

# Push changes
git push origin feature/your-branch
```
